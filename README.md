### Howdy ðŸ‘‹

And welcome to my GitHub profile.

The tools of my trade would be PHP, Laravel, Tailwind, Livewire, Alpine.js, TypeScript, Wordpress, and some knowledge of the Shopify platform, particularly their Liquid templating.

Currently expanding my knowledge of Vue.js, as well as the Godot game engine and it's associated language GDScript.

How to reach me would be by headin' on over to [my portfolio site](https://alex.quest/contact) and toss me a message via the contact form, or heck, poke me on Discord. Same handle as my Twitter account.
