### Howdy ðŸ‘‹

And welcome to my GitHub profile.

I'm currently working at [1260](https://1260.dk)

The tools of my trade would be PHP, Laravel, Tailwind, Livewire, Alpine.js, Vue, Wordpress, and some knowledge of the Shopify platform, particularly their Liquid templating.

I'm currently learning all I can about Unity and related C#, by making a game with it. It's exciting stuff, and I hope it turns out great, even if I'm storing it in a private repo. ;)

How to reach me would be by headin' on over to [my portfolio site](https://alex.quest/contact) and toss me a message via the contact form.
