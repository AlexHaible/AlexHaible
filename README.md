### Howdy ðŸ‘‹

And welcome to my GitHub profile.

The tools of my trade would be PHP, Laravel, Tailwind, Livewire, Alpine.js, Wordpress, and some knowledge of the Shopify platform, particularly their Liquid templating.

I'm currently learning all I can about Unity and related C#, by making a game with it. It's exciting stuff, and I hope it turns out great, even if I'm storing it in a private repo. ;)

How to reach me would be by headin' on over to [my portfolio site](https://alex.quest/contact) and toss me a message via the contact form.
